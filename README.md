# Description
Dominion Card Generator is a simple-to-use application that allows Dominion players to generate cards to play with.

# Features
- DCG randomly chooses cards for Dominion players to play with.
- The users can stay with the default of 10 cards, or choose to generate a larger amount and then 'ban' cards.
- If the user wishes to view all cards, that is an option as well.
- When a card is selected, the card's information (Name, Cost, Type, Set, and Description) are displayed.)
- When cards are generated, whatever cards are to also be played with are shown as well. (e.g. When a Witch is in play, a curse should also be played with as well (Witch description: (Each other player gains a Curse card.)))
- Not all users own all Promotional cards. Because of this, users can select which promotional cards they do own.
