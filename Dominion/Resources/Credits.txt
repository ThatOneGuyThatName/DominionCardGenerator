Program name:
     Dominion Card Generator
Description:
     DCG randomly chooses cards for Dominion players to play with.
     The users can stay with the default of 10 cards, or choose to generate more than that amount and then 'ban' cards.
     If the user wishes to view all cards, that is an option as well.
     When a card is selected, the card's information (Name, Cost, Type, Set, and Description) are displayed as well.)
     When cards are generated, whatever cards are to also be played with are shown as well. (e.g. When a Witch is in play, a curse should also be played with as well (Witch description: (Each other player gains a Curse card.)))
     Not all users own all Promotional cards. Because of this, users can select which promotional cards they do own.
